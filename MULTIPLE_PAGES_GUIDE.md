# Multiple Link Pages Feature Guide

## Overview

LinkToMe now supports creating multiple link pages, allowing you to organize your content for different audiences, purposes, or brands. This powerful feature is available to Pro, Premium, and Enterprise tier users.

## What are Multiple Pages?

Multiple pages allow you to create separate link collections, each with:
- Its own unique URL slug (e.g., `yourname.com/music`, `yourname.com/business`)
- Independent set of links and link collections
- Custom appearance and styling
- Separate analytics tracking

## Tier Limits

Different subscription tiers have different limits on the number of pages you can create:

| Tier | Maximum Pages |
|------|---------------|
| **Free** | 1 (default page only) |
| **Pro** | 3 pages |
| **Premium** | 10 pages |
| **Enterprise** | Unlimited |

## Creating Your First Additional Page

### Step 1: Navigate to Pages Management

1. Log in to your LinkToMe dashboard
2. Click on **Pages** in the sidebar menu
3. Click the **Create New Page** button

### Step 2: Configure Your Page

When creating a new page, you'll need to provide:

1. **Page Name**: A friendly name to help you identify the page (e.g., "Music Links", "Business", "Social Media")
   
2. **Page Slug**: A URL-friendly identifier that will appear in your page's URL
   - Must be 3-30 characters long
   - Can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens
   - Cannot start or end with a hyphen
   - Example: If your slug is "music", your page will be at `linkto.me/yourname/music`

3. **Set as Default** (optional): Check this if you want this page to be shown when someone visits your main profile URL (`linkto.me/yourname`)

### Step 3: Add Links to Your Page

1. After creating your page, use the page selector in the top navigation bar to switch between pages
2. Add links as you normally would - they will be associated with the currently selected page
3. Each page maintains its own set of links, groups, and settings

## Managing Your Pages

### Switching Between Pages

- Use the **page selector** in the top navigation bar (appears on Links, Appearance, and Analytics pages)
- Click to see all your pages and select the one you want to edit
- The currently selected page is marked with a checkmark
- Your default page is marked with a star icon

### Editing a Page

1. Go to the **Pages** section in the sidebar
2. Click the menu icon (⋮) on the page you want to edit
3. Select **Edit Page**
4. Update the name, slug, or default setting
5. Click **Update**

### Setting a Default Page

Your default page is the one shown when someone visits your main profile URL without a specific slug.

To set a page as default:
1. Go to the **Pages** section
2. Click the menu icon (⋮) on the desired page
3. Select **Set as Default**

Note: Only one page can be default at a time. Setting a new default will automatically unset the previous one.

### Deleting a Page

⚠️ **Warning**: Deleting a page will permanently remove all links, collections, and appearance settings for that page.

To delete a page:
1. Go to the **Pages** section
2. Click the menu icon (⋮) on the page you want to delete
3. Select **Delete Page**
4. Confirm the deletion

Note: You cannot delete your default page. Set another page as default first if you want to delete the current default.

### Copying a Page URL

To share a specific page:
1. Go to the **Pages** section
2. Click **Copy Link** on the desired page
3. The full URL will be copied to your clipboard
4. Share it on social media, email, or anywhere else!

## Page-Specific Features

### Independent Link Management

Each page has its own:
- Set of links
- Link collections (groups)
- Link ordering
- Active/inactive status per link

Links on one page do not affect links on another page.

### Independent Appearance

Each page can have completely different styling:
- Background/wallpaper
- Button styles
- Color schemes
- Fonts
- Header layout
- Social icons

Customize each page to match its purpose or audience.

### Separate Analytics

Analytics are tracked separately for each page:
- View the combined analytics for all pages
- Filter analytics by specific page
- See which page is getting the most engagement

## Use Cases

### Example 1: Content Creator

Create separate pages for different content types:
- **Main** (`/main`): General social media links
- **Music** (`/music`): Music streaming platforms and tour dates
- **Merch** (`/merch`): Online store and merchandise links
- **Collab** (`/collab`): Business inquiries and collaboration links

### Example 2: Freelancer

Organize your professional presence:
- **Portfolio** (`/portfolio`): Work samples and case studies
- **Services** (`/services`): Service offerings and pricing
- **Contact** (`/contact`): Contact forms and scheduling links
- **Blog** (`/blog`): Recent articles and content

### Example 3: Small Business

Segment by customer type:
- **Shop** (`/shop`) - Default page: Product catalog and online store
- **Wholesale** (`/wholesale`): Bulk ordering and distributor information
- **Support** (`/support`): Customer service and FAQ resources

### Example 4: Event Organizer

Create event-specific pages:
- **Main**: Current events and general information
- **Festival-2024** (`/festival-2024`): Specific festival lineup, tickets, schedule
- **Workshop** (`/workshop`): Workshop registration and materials
- **Past-Events** (`/archive`): Archive of past events

## Tips and Best Practices

### Choosing Good Slugs

- Keep them short and memorable
- Make them descriptive of the page content
- Use lowercase for consistency
- Avoid special characters
- Examples: `music`, `shop`, `contact`, `portfolio`

### Organizing Your Pages

- Set your most important or general page as default
- Use clear naming to easily identify pages in the admin
- Consider your audience when deciding what pages to create
- Don't create too many pages - focus on what your audience needs

### Content Strategy

- Keep each page focused on a specific theme or audience
- Cross-promote your pages where appropriate
- Update your page links regularly
- Consider seasonal pages for events or promotions

### URL Sharing

- **Default page**: `linkto.me/yourname` (no slug needed)
- **Specific page**: `linkto.me/yourname/slug`
- Share the right page link for the right context
- Use short URLs in bios, limited-space environments

## Upgrading for More Pages

If you've reached your page limit and need more pages:

1. Go to **Subscription** in the sidebar
2. View available upgrade options
3. Choose a tier with more pages:
   - **Pro**: 3 pages
   - **Premium**: 10 pages
   - **Enterprise**: Unlimited pages
4. Complete the upgrade process

Your existing pages and settings will be preserved when upgrading.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have different links on different pages?

Yes! Each page has completely independent links. A link on one page will not appear on another unless you manually add it.

### What happens to my links when I upgrade?

All your existing links remain on your current page. You can then create additional pages and add new links to them.

### Can I move links between pages?

Currently, links cannot be moved between pages. You would need to recreate them on the new page. This ensures clean separation between pages.

### Can I have the same link on multiple pages?

Yes, you can add the same URL to multiple pages. Each instance is tracked separately for analytics.

### What happens if I downgrade and exceed the page limit?

If you downgrade to a tier with fewer allowed pages, your existing pages will remain but be set to inactive. You'll need to delete pages to get under the limit or upgrade again to reactivate them.

### Can free users see multiple pages from paid users?

Yes! Anyone can view any of your pages by visiting the specific URL. The multiple pages feature is about creation and management, not viewing.

### Do search engines index all my pages?

Yes, each page is a separate URL that can be indexed by search engines, potentially improving your discoverability.
