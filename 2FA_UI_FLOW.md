## User Flow Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Login with Email 2FA

1. **Login Page** (`/login`)
   - User enters email and password
   - Completes Turnstile security check
   - Clicks "Login" button

2. **Backend Returns 2FA Challenge**
   - Response: `{ requires2FA: true, twoFactorMethod: 'email', sessionId: '...' }`
   - Frontend automatically switches to 2FA view

3. **2FA Verification Page** (same card, different content)
   - Shows email icon
   - Title: "Two-Factor Authentication"
   - Subtitle: "Enter the 6-digit code sent to your email"
   - 6 input boxes for code entry
   - "Verify" button
   - "Resend Code" link (with countdown)
   - "Back to login" link

4. **User Actions:**
   - Types 6-digit code (or pastes it)
   - Clicks "Verify" or presses Enter
   - If correct: Redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
   - If incorrect: Error message displayed, can retry

### Scenario 2: Login with TOTP 2FA

1-2. Same as Email 2FA scenario

3. **2FA Verification Page** (TOTP variant)
   - Shows security/lock icon
   - Title: "Two-Factor Authentication"
   - Subtitle: "Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app"
   - 6 input boxes for code entry
   - "Verify" button
   - NO "Resend Code" link (TOTP codes are generated by app)
   - "Back to login" link

4. **User Actions:**
   - Opens authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, etc.)
   - Types current TOTP code
   - Clicks "Verify"
   - If correct: Redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
   - If incorrect: Error message displayed, can retry

### Scenario 3: Signup with 2FA

Same flow as login, but starts from signup form:
1. User enters email, username, password
2. Completes Turnstile
3. Clicks "Sign Up"
4. If backend requires 2FA setup during signup, shows 2FA verification
5. Verifies and redirects to dashboard

### Scenario 4: Resending Email Code

1. User is on 2FA verification page (email method or dual-method showing TOTP)
2. For dual-method: Wants to use email instead of TOTP, OR didn't receive code
3. Clicks "Resend Code" link
4. Email code is generated and sent (first time for dual-method users)
5. Link shows "Resend in Xs" countdown for 60 seconds
6. After countdown, can click again to get a new code
7. User enters email code and verifies

### Scenario 5: User with Both Methods Enabled (Dual 2FA)

1. **Login Page** (`/login`)
   - User enters email and password
   - Completes Turnstile security check
   - Clicks "Login" button

2. **Backend Returns 2FA Challenge with Both Methods**
   - Response: `{ requires2FA: true, twoFactorMethod: "both", availableMethods: ["email", "totp"], sessionId: '...' }`
   - Email code is sent automatically
   - Frontend shows 2FA verification page

3. **2FA Verification Page** (Current Implementation)
   - Shows email icon and instructions by default
   - Displays: "Enter the 6-digit code sent to your email"
   - User can enter EITHER:
     - The 6-digit code from their email
     - The 6-digit code from their authenticator app
   - Backend will accept whichever code is valid
   - "Resend Code" link available (only resends email)

4. **User Actions:**
   - Option A: Check email, enter email code, verify ✓
   - Option B: Open authenticator app, enter TOTP code, verify ✓
   - Both work equally well
   - If incorrect code: Error message, can retry with either method

5. **Future Enhancement**:
   - Show "Use authenticator app instead" link
   - Allow user to switch methods
   - UI updates to show TOTP instructions when switched
   - Remember user's preference for next login

### Scenario 6: Switching Methods (Future Feature)

1. User is on 2FA verification page with both methods available
2. Currently showing TOTP by default
3. Clicks "Use email code instead" link (future feature)
4. UI updates:
   - Changes icon from security/lock to email
   - Updates text: "Enter the 6-digit code sent to your email"
   - Triggers email code generation and sending if not already sent
   - Shows "Resend Code" link
5. User enters email code
6. Clicks "Verify"
7. If needed, can click "Use authenticator app instead" to switch back to TOTP

### Scenario 5: User with Both Methods Enabled (Dual 2FA)

1. **Login Page** (`/login`)
   - User enters email and password
   - Completes Turnstile security check
   - Clicks "Login" button

2. **Backend Returns 2FA Challenge with Both Methods**
   - Response: `{ requires2FA: true, twoFactorMethod: "both", availableMethods: ["email", "totp"], sessionId: '...' }`
   - **Email code is NOT sent automatically** (to avoid unnecessary emails)
   - Frontend shows 2FA verification page

3. **2FA Verification Page** (Current Implementation)
   - **Shows TOTP/security icon and instructions by default** (preferred method)
   - Displays: "Enter the 6-digit code from your authenticator app"
   - "Resend Code" link available - clicking it:
     - Triggers email generation and sending
     - Allows user to use email method if they prefer or don't have access to their authenticator
   - User can enter EITHER:
     - The 6-digit code from their authenticator app (TOTP)
     - Request and use the 6-digit code from their email (by clicking Resend Code first)
   - Backend will accept whichever code is valid

4. **User Actions:**
   - Option A: Open authenticator app, enter TOTP code, verify ✓ (default flow)
   - Option B: Click "Resend Code" → email is sent → enter email code, verify ✓
   - Both work equally well
   - If incorrect code: Error message, can retry with either method

5. **Future Enhancement**:
   - Show "Use email instead" link to explicitly switch methods
   - Allow user to toggle between methods before requesting email
   - Remember user's preference for next login

### Scenario 6: Switching Methods (Future Feature)

1. User is on 2FA verification page with both methods available
2. Currently showing TOTP by default
3. Clicks "Use email code instead" link (future feature)
4. UI updates:
   - Changes icon from security/lock to email
   - Updates text: "Enter the 6-digit code sent to your email"
   - Triggers email code generation and sending if not already sent
   - Shows "Resend Code" link
5. User enters email code
6. Clicks "Verify"
7. If needed, can click "Use authenticator app instead" to switch back to TOTP

## Code Structure

### Login Page State Management

```typescript
// 2FA state
const [show2FA, setShow2FA] = useState<boolean>(false);
const [twoFactorMethod, setTwoFactorMethod] = useState<'email' | 'totp'>('email');
const [twoFactorSessionId, setTwoFactorSessionId] = useState<string>('');
const [twoFactorLoading, setTwoFactorLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);
```

### Key Functions

1. **handleSubmit**: Submits login/signup, checks for 2FA requirement
2. **handle2FAVerify**: Verifies 2FA token via API
3. **handle2FAResend**: Resends email code (email method only)
4. **handle2FABack**: Returns to login/signup form

### Conditional Rendering

```typescript
{show2FA ? (
  <TwoFactorAuth
    method={twoFactorMethod}
    sessionId={twoFactorSessionId}
    onVerify={handle2FAVerify}
    onResendEmail={twoFactorMethod === 'email' ? handle2FAResend : undefined}
    loading={twoFactorLoading}
    error={error}
    onBack={handle2FABack}
  />
) : (
  // Login/Signup form
)}
```

## Error Handling

### Possible Errors:

1. **Invalid verification code**
   - Red alert below input boxes
   - Message: "Invalid verification code"
   - Inputs remain filled, user can edit

2. **Session expired**
   - Red alert: "Session expired or invalid"
   - Suggests clicking "Back to login" to start over

3. **Too many attempts**
   - Red alert: "Too many failed attempts. Please try again later."
   - May disable verify button

4. **Resend rate limit**
   - Shows countdown: "Resend in 45s"
   - Link disabled until countdown reaches 0

## Accessibility Features

1. **Keyboard Navigation:**
   - Tab through inputs
   - Arrow keys respected
   - Enter to submit
   - Backspace to go back

2. **Screen Readers:**
   - Proper ARIA labels on inputs
   - Error messages announced
   - Button states announced

3. **Visual:**

   - Clear error messages

## Mobile Responsiveness

- Card adapts to screen size

## Security Features

1. **Single-use codes**: Each code can only be used once
2. **Time-limited**: Sessions expire after 10 minutes
3. **Rate limiting**: Max attempts enforced by backend
4. **No code display**: Codes never shown in UI (user must check email/app)
5. **Secure transmission**: All API calls over HTTPS
